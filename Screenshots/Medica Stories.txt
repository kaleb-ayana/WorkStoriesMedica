Update EDS Load API for Location PRoviders
"AFter review of the current design it was 
decided that the logic needs to change for the 
location records to align with how we are 
loading check org and practitioner provider 
records so that we carry the MTV id and persist 
the data at the same grandularity for all providers.
This will allow us to solve for the Stale Location 
records when a new Location key is generated from an update/delete."
